# Something Linux

Hi! I'm Adam and I am currently aiming to become an exceptional Cloud/ DevOps Engineer. I'm taking the necessary steps to prepare myself for my future role. 

I started this Linux repo/ challenge cause I believe it is an execellent way to document my learning process and help me stay accountable to myself.

By the end of this repo day, I hope to be profficient with linux and be able to go straight into the deep end.
