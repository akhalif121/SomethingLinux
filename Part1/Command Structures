CommandName Options Inputs 

However, not all commands require an input.

If you enter the calendar ðŸ—“ "cal" command the current month with the highlight day would appear.

Some commands can also be given two inputs. If the command "cal 4 2022" was entered, the complete calendar ðŸ—“ of the month of april should appear.
