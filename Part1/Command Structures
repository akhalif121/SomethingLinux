All commands are essentially programs which are already on your PC.

The general command structure would be:
CommandName Options Inputs 

CommandName needs to be on the shell search path.

options modify a commands behaviour.

Commands operate on inputs.

However, not all commands require an input.

If you enter the calendar ðŸ—“ "cal" command the current month with the highlight day would appear.

 </p>

On the other hand if you enter "cal 2022" command the complete years calendar ðŸ—“ appears. The input of the command caused the output to change.


Some commands can also be given two inputs. If the command "cal 4 2022" was entered, the complete calendar ðŸ—“ of the month of april should appear.


2 types of options - Long form options and short form options 

Short form options can be combined for example: "date -abcdefg"

Short form options do not need to be in any particular order for the command to be accepted: "date -bagfced"

Long form options cannot be combined and also need 2 "--" for example "date -universal" is the long form option in comparison to the short form option "-u"
